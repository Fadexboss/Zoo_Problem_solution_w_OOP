This software project is designed to create a zoo simulation based on the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. The project demonstrates the solution of a system that simulates the movement, reproduction and death of animals within a zoo.


### Problem

There are 30 sheep (15 males, 15 females), 10 cows (5 males, 5 females), 10 chickens, 10 wolves (5 females, 5 males), 10 roosters, 8 lions (4 males, 4 females) and 1 hunter living in an area of ​​500 by 500.

Of the animals;
sheep 2 units,
wolf 3 units,
cow 2 units,
chicken 1 unit,
rooster 1 unit,
lion 4 units,
hunter 1 unit moves randomly but cannot go out of the area.
wolf can hunt sheep, chicken, rooster within 4 units of itself.
lion can hunt cows, sheep within 5 units of itself.
hunter can hunt any of the animals within 8 units of itself.
when animals of the same sex or different sex get 3 units closer to each other, a random
sex and same sex animal is formed.
It is expected that a console application will be written that will find the number of animals at the end of 1000 units of movement.
